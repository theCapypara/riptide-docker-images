# What is §§YOUR_IMAGE_NAME§§?

<!-- Description of your image here -->

# How to use this image.

<!-- General usage notes. After this, keep the following text: -->

This image is meant to be used with [Riptide](https://github.com/theCapypara/riptide-cli). 
Using it without Riptide is probably possible, but not supported.

## Basic Usage with Riptide

<!--- Example of running this image with Riptide (eg. an example Service) 
      and a short explanation --->
      
<!--- If the image is meant to be used only for services OR commands, state this here --->

<!--- Depending on the three cases in the README.rst under Contributing, 
      provide one of the following texts: --->
  
<!--- CASE 1: Runnable via entrypoint user/group --->
This image supports ``run_as_current_user: true`` for services (this is the default).

<!--- CASE 2: Runnable via USER and GROUP env variables --->
This image only supports ``run_as_current_user: false`` for services.
To run the image with the user controlling riptide, instead of the image user, provide the USER and GROUP environment variables,
as shown in the example above.
<!--- In this case your example must be a service and contain:
    environment:
        USER: '{{ os_user() }}'
        GROUP: '{{ os_group() }}'
--->

<!--- CASE 3: Only runnable as user defined in Dockerfile (or root): --->
This image only supports ``run_as_current_user: false`` for services.

## Basic Usage with Docker Run

<!--- Example of running this image with plain docker run 
      and a short explanation --->

# Environment Variables

<!-- Below are examples. USER and GROUP can be kept as is for CASE 2
     Images -->
 
| Name      | Required | Example Value(s)                    | Description                                                         |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USER      | yes      | 1000 / {{ os_user() }} (Riptide)    | ID of the user that the main command should switch to               |   
| GROUP     | yes      | 1000 / {{ os_group() }} (Riptide)   | ID of the group that the main command should switch to              |
