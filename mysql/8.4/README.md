# What is this image?

This image contains MySQL 8.4 with a `su` binary.

# How to use this image.

See the description of the [official MySQL images](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql).

This image is meant to be used with [Riptide](https://github.com/theCapypara/riptide-cli). 
Using it without Riptide is probably possible, but not supported.
